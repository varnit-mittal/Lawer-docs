# Scalability

Lawer currently operates upon Indian law database with the api of the [indiankanoon.org](https://indiankanoon.org/). This application has a huge scalability and our team is soon gonna start on some of them. Some possible extensions are:- 
<ul>

    <li>Extension towards the legal databases of other nations</li>
    <li>Multi language support</li>
    <li>Multi platform support</li>
</ul>
Extending overseas demands access to the central government judicial databases, this will not only enable us to remove a lot of third party issues, but also handle a bigger set of queries and situations. Some extensions can be there provide extra features such as a legal helper that advises a course of action in certain situations. We want lawer to be in the hands of every citizen, resulting in a world with a much higher legal awareness.
